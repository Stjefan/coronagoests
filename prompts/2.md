For our ui and easier understanding of the classes we want the following UI datastructure for Trassen:
Trasse (Powerline): Name, Template
Template describes the pole structure (levels, connection on the left and right for each level)
Poles: Position, poleHeight, orientation
Levels: levelHeight
Connections: horizontalDistance2Pole, conntected2Connection (from next Pole, None for last pole)
ConnectionLines: ConnectionLineType, MaxSag

ConnectionLines: Pair of Connections where one references the other via conntected2Connection

Needs to be transformable to and from trasse4gelaende.json or the type used in UsedDataCalculator.

Create test cases how you can perform this transformations. We should be able to retrieve the same results.
Create plan how you can integrate this in the ui. You can remove any current implementation for trassen in the ui, as it does not work.
