Implement a leaflet react simple crs where you show the Lageplan.jpg from public. We need to use a helmert transform based on the fields: "GKR_A", "GKH_A", "GKR_B", "GKH_B", "PX_A", "PY_A", "PX_B","PY_B" from project data. Then place the ImmissionPoints (based on the their transformation from gkrechts, gkhoch into pixel coordinates) on the map. Similar for ESQSources and Hoehenpunkte.
